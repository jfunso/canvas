Create a painting application that allows you to create art by clicking and dragging the mouse across the canvas.  
 
Include options for changing the drawing colour and line thickness.  
 
Provide red, green and blue sliders that allow you to select the RGB colour.  
 
Provide a line-width dialog with a single slider that controls the thickness of the line that youâ€™ll draw. 
 
Also include options that allow you to turn the cursor into an eraser, to clear the screen and to save the current drawing.  
At any point, you should be able to clear the entire drawing from the canvas.
